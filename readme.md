# KOW
Another PHP framework. I created this when I was studying about middlewares and PHP-DI and I came up with this... framework.

# How it works
It's just a middleware pipeline with PSR-7 and PSR-15 (draft yet) that has a router-dispatcher-ish middleware to simulate MVC.

# Want to contribute?
Just fork and pull request

# Install
As it's just a study framework (at least, for now), just clone the repo.
